# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to use Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape data to create a unique website that pulls the most recent information on Mars from other websites. The collected data was stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB, and then Flask was used to create the unique webpage. Bootstrap was used in the HTML file in order to shrink the "Scrape New Data" button, and to adjust the layout of the Mars hemisphere thumbnails. The webpage was also made mobile-friendly using grid layout.
